THE GAME 
========

Development environment for 3D games, testing, skyboxes, advanced graphics
techniques, graphics from scratch, bgfx, imgui, etc. 

Currently only runs on linux. Hopefully I will make a step-by-step compilation
guide on YouTube because bgfx is quite a beast to build along with other
dependencies. 

SUBMODULES
